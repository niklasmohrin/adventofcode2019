# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to the riddles of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

All the problems around the Intcode Computer are written in Rust and contain documentation comments to be used with `cargo doc` as well as comments in the code.

All other problems are solved with Python 3.
